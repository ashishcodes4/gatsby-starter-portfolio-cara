## About Me

I am a Product Engineer, and creator of [DevConnector](guarded-thicket-68629.herokuapp.com). I have 2 years commercial experience providing UI/UX development , producing high quality responsive websites and exceptional user experience.

> Often front-end development of a product is overlooked, but being the part of your project that combines design, back-end development and the layer that your users interact with, from my experience, it is the most important to get right.
Keeping that in mind, I am highly motivated towards buliding products that brings true value to the end user.
